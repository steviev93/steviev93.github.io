<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>My name is Stephen (I prefer to go by Stevie).</p>
<p>My love for coding started a little over two years ago, where I started with Python 
    geared towards Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis. 
    Over time I grew an affinity for software development, having picked up C# and the .NET stack.</p>
<p>My hobbies include IoT, playing music (drummer) and playing video games (Fallout 4 is my recent addiction).</p>
